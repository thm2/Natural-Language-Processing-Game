    "This is an algorithm that plays the game of Hangman efficiently, with approximatly 55% word-guessing accuracy on dictionaries of hard difficulty. This accuracy is achieved through the algorithm's \"guess\" function. Compared to other implementations, this is a consice and efficient way of guessing the next letter of an unknown word in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user plays Hangman, the game first selects a secret word at random from a list. The game then returns a row of underscores (space separated)—one for each letter in the secret word—and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user has made a prespecified number of incorrect guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses a training set of approximately 250,000 dictionary words. The algorithm is tested on an entirely disjoint set of 250,000 dictionary words. This means the words that ultimately the algorithm is tested on do NOT appear in the dictionary that the algorithm is trained on. "
